## 🗒️ My Note-Taking Stack

I use [![KaraKeep](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kara-keep-white)](https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep) on my Raspberry Pi for capturing notes—open-source, self-hosted, and built for peace of mind.

It offers:
- End-to-end control (no third-party storage)
- A clean, responsive interface
- Quick setup and reliable performance

> Minimal bugs, zero noise, fully mine.
