# About Me

Hello, I'm Zakariya! Here, you'll find a unique blend of hardcore technical architecture and a design philosophy that resonates with common sense.

## My Skills

- **Container Orchestration:** I conduct Docker containers with the finesse of a maestro, creating harmonious symphonies out of complex arrangements.
- **Virtual Machine Setup:** My VM setups are more akin to zen gardens than traditional server racks, offering a calming and efficient environment.
- **Documentation:** I produce documentation that doesn't make you question your life choices. Every configuration file I touch becomes part of a carefully curated archive—because if you're not treating your dotfiles like historical artifacts, are you even doing it right?  
    I'm borderline obsessive about future-proofing, intentional architecture, and what I affectionately call "documentation that doesn't hate you." My philosophy is simple: technical precision shouldn't come at the cost of your sanity. Each project I build strikes a deliberate balance between rock-solid engineering and actual human usability—optimized for flow states, not frustration spirals.  
    My process involves constant iteration, meticulous tagging, and journaling every modification like I'm chronicling the evolution of a digital ecosystem. Which, let's be real, I kind of am. Some people collect stamps; I collect perfectly optimized workflows and config tweaks that spark joy at 3 AM.  
    This entire site is essentially my public notebook—a living document where infrastructure philosophy meets personal expression, where technical depth coexists with aesthetic minimalism, and where every commit tells a story about the pursuit of systems that just work. If any of this resonates, dive in and explore. Clone something. Break something. Learn something. Or just vibe with the aesthetic—no judgment either way.  
    Consider this your open invitation to a space where code is craft, configs are poetry, and documentation is actually worth reading. Welcome to the archive. Stay a while.
