## ðŸªŸ My Windows Setup Flow

Hereâ€™s how I install and streamline Windows with as little noise as possible:

1. Download the ISO via [![OSClick](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSClick-purple)](https://os.click/en)  
2. Follow [![this guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/This_guide-red)](https://rtech.support/installations/install-11/) for a clean install  
3. Use AME Wizard to apply the [![ReviOS playbook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Revi_OS-playbook-red)](https://revi.cc) for de-bloating  
4. Reboot, patch drivers, and you're readyâ€”fast, clean, focused.

> Lightweight, no telemetry, no fluff. Just Windows, the way it should be.
