## 📓 What is Config Journal?

*Config Journal* is a plain-text archive of my personal digital setup—focused on simplicity, privacy, and efficiency. No configs to clone, no scripts to run—just clean markdown notes documenting the apps I use, the tweaks I make, and how I stay focused in a bloated digital world. This repository is also MY take on (almost) everything tech.

## 📎 Notion Workspace  
All documents, experiments, and general chaos live here:

This repo is for:
- 🧠 Curious tinkerers looking for minimalist toolchains
- 🛠️ Anyone setting up a clean workspace without diving into dotfiles
- 📥 Future me, remembering why I switched that extension or retired that app

Minimal stack, maximum clarity.
