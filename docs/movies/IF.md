### 📖 The Premise
A young girl discovers she can see everyone's abandoned imaginary friends (IFs) and decides to help them reconnect with their now-grown-up humans. It’s basically 'Toy Story' but for the stuff that lives in your head.

### ⚙️ The Technical Flex (CGI & Integration)
As a 'tech-person' I thought the CGI was pretty good; it felt as IF (haha, get it? no i'll stop 😔) they were occupying real space. 

---

### 🎧 The Atmosphere & Score
I thought that this music was great. It had the perfect amount of mystery with nice tune. Hanz Zimmer never disappoints.

### ⚖️ The "Doesn't Match" Verdict
If you're wondering, yes, this is completely random, and no, it's not going to change

---

### 🏁 Final Verdict
Not a masterpiece, but a good watch. I think you, yes *you* would enjoy it. It's streaming on Netflix, or if that's not your thing, it's rent or buy on Prime Video.

**Favorite IFs:**
1. Louis, not the main character but he influenced the story enough to be here. (RIP Louis Gossett Jr. 29 March, 2024 🕊️)
2. Cal, it's Ryan Reynolds, what can I say here?
3. Magician Mouse, just the right amount of New York, with some mouse too.

### 🔚 The End
Anyway, that's all I got. See you in the next one my friend, love you.
