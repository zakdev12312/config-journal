The Adam Reed from the future time travels back to 2022 to team up with 12-year-old self to save the future by preventing their father from inventing time travel

### 🛠️ The Technical Flex
I don't really have one. It's just a really good, and funny movie 🤷‍♂️.

There is a paradox of 'will I remember this in the future? Paradoxes always perplex me, so I can't really comment.

Very funny, and hooking movie. What do you think? [I'd love to know](https://forms.gle/6bvL1YC1VntVBEEcA)
