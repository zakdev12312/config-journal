# 🎨 Typography Reference

A curated collection of fonts I’ve explored for my digital workspace, Docsify themes, and personal branding. Each section includes a live-rendered sample using inline CSS so you can compare vibes directly in the browser.

---

## **Roboto** – Clean & Neutral

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

Used as the sidebar title font. Minimal, balanced, and well-supported across browsers.

---

## **Fira Code** – Monospace with Ligatures

function example() => return true;

Perfect for developer vibes, great in terminals and Docsify code blocks.

---

## **JetBrains Mono** – Aesthetic Coding Font

let zen = () => config.journal();

Sharper and softer than Fira, with great readability and slight flair.

---

## **Inter** – UI-Friendly Sans

Simplicity isn’t a lack of content—it’s the clarity of intention.

Well-paired with minimal designs, feels calm and professional.

---

## **IBM Plex Sans** – Technical & Stylish

System defaults reimagined with thoughtful polish.

Works well across headers, nav, and body copy. Underrated.

## Notes

- To try one of these yourself, include a `<link>` in your `index.html` like:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fira+Code&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" />
```
