# About Me

Hey — I'm Zakariya.

I document my setup because I believe tools should be quiet, purposeful, and personal. This repo is my config journal: a space to think clearly about the defaults I trust, the tweaks I make, and the systems I build.

> No noise. No bloat. Just the stack I live with, day to day.

I care about privacy-first software, digital minimalism, and workflows that respect both your time and your attention. This journal isn't just technical — it's philosophical. It's my digital handwriting.

Thanks for being here.
