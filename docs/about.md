# 🤔 ABOUT THIS VAULT

Welcome to the **Config Journal** — a digital garden of tools, thoughts, and tactical overthinks.

This isn’t a how-to. It’s a *why-I*.  
A place where every extension, keyboard shortcut, and rogue folder name has a backstory. This repo exists to make sense of it all — for me, for anyone nosy, and for the version of me who forgot why I exiled that “productivity” app last summer.

---

## 🧪 Origins  
Started as a list. Became a habit. Eventually turned into a vault of personal OS standards, irreverent observations, and app retirements with full honors.

---

## 🔍 What You’ll Find  
- Docs on the tools I *actually* use  
- Opinions disguised as policies  
- Workflow notes with more structure than my calendar  
- Notion pages for everything too chaotic for Markdown  
- A gentle war against feature bloat

---

## 💡 Philosophy  
- **Minimal is good. Intentional is better.**  
- **Privacy isn’t a feature request.**  
- **If it doesn’t spark joy, it doesn’t get root access.**

---

## 📦 Why This Exists  
So I don’t forget.  
So you don’t have to start from zero.  
And because somewhere out there, another human is wondering if it’s okay to uninstall half their setup and just run what feels right.

(It is.)
