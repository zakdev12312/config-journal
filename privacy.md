Regarding privacy, Kasm Workspaces CE is one of the best free-to-use privacy tools out there. However it did take time for me to set it up (~1 hour) but all worth it. It relies on docker containers to stream them to your browser. It has modest system requirements, you can run it in a VM (you need about 16GB of RAM in your server of choice).
Tor is easily the most secure browser for browsing anywhere, based on Firefox.
